			<h2>Process of Creation</h2>
			<hr>
			<p>I consider myself more artisan than artist in that the work I do introduces old world manual skills, such
			as wood working and pyrography (the process of burning designs onto a surface) to create
			contemporary objects that blur the line between craft and art.</p>
			<img class="pull-right img-responsive" src="images/gourdinprogress.jpg">
			<p>Isabelle Guesin, a professor of textile design at a well-regarded art academy in Paris says, “working with
			your hands is a slow, painstaking process that requires patience unseen in today’s society”. And I would
			go further to add that the practice of patience required in my work is a meditative act, quieting the daily 
			grind of multitasking and demands each day brings. This has become especially true in a world where technology
			promises enrichment but fails to support our ability to concentrate and find meaning beyond our
			computer screens.</p>
			<p>I think of my lamps as sculptures that become transformed through illumination at night, which in turn
			transform the spaces they are in, adding beauty and a ‘softening’ experience to the gazer. The inner
			membrane of the gourd is exposed through carving which acts as a screen for the light from inside.
			Depending on the depth of the carved surface, reds, oranges, and yellows are produced and the addition
			of hundreds of holes on the surface allows the light to pass out of the gourd directly and form patterns
			on walls and other surfaces which are close to the lamp when it is lit.</p>

			<h2>Pricing</h2>
			<hr>
			<p>My prices are based upon the complexity, scale, and time devoted to creating each lamp. 
			From the initial cleaning  of the  dried gourd to the finished piece.</p>
			<p>At least fifty hours, if not more, are spent in the multi-layered process. In this context, the value of the lamps far exceeds 
			the price paid. Please be assured that I also take into consideration what the market bears for similar work.</p>
			<p>A percentage of the proceeds will be dononated to the ASPCA.</p>
